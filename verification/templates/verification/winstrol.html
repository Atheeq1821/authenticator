              It was developed by Winthrop Laboratories (Sterling Drug) in 1962, and has been approved by the FDA for human use.
              Stanozolol is a17-alpha-alkylated anabolic steroid with good oral bioavailability. While Stanozolols androgenic activity index is nearly the same as testosterone, its myotrophic activity is much higher at 2.0:3.7.
              Stanozolol does not aromatize and does not cause water retention.

              Stanozolol has been used for weight loss management in HIV patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has showed significant improvement in weight, body mass index, LBM, and muscle size.
              Stanozolol has been shown in-vitro to significantly enhance collagen synthesis. A positive effect of Stanozolol on wound healing in patients with non-healing wounds has also been demonstrated.
              Clinical studies show that the treatment with Stanozolol during the induction phase of chemotherapy results in a positive effect on the duration of cancer-free remission.

              For bodybuilders there are few better, more trusted or well respected compounds than Stanozolol and with a usage history that stems back over 50 years in the bodybuilding world, Stanozolol has learnt its place in the top 5 bodybuilding drugs of all time.
              Very few steroids will give the hardness, density and vascularization that this drug will, and International Anabolics now offers this classic in a GSO suspension which eliminates the pain and discomfort felt from the inferior water based suspension.",

                <h2>HOW TO DILUTE/ CUT HIGH MG OILS</h2>
                <p>Some of our injectables are highly concentrated and will produce pain during injection and afterward (PIP) if injected directly.
                     To prevent this, you need to dilute (cut) these HIGH-MG injectables with a carrier oil/base.

                     Generally, anything above 250mg/ml should be diluted before injection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <h2>How to Dilute:</h2>
                <p>1.Determine which base you need:
                     Look at the ingredients list on the product page OR on the label.
                     Made with Grape seed oil (GSO)? Dilute with Sterile Oil.
                     Made with PEG/MEG/Glycol base? Dilute with PEG/MEG BASE.
                   2.Mix your product with the corresponding base in a syringe (or a new sterile vial).
                     Initially, mix with a 1:1 ratio, diluting more if needed.
                     Example: Mix 0.5ml of Gigatest 750 with 0.5ml grape seed oil in the same syringe.

                <h2>Dianabol Recommendations</h2>
                <p>The dosage range for Dianabol is typically 20-50 mg/day. Unlike most injectables, little further benefit occurs from going beyond this milligram amount. If wishing more effect, the answer is instead to add another anabolic steroid. My preference is for dosing to be 3-5 times per day, but some prefer to use it only once per day.

                    Typically, this usage is combined with about 500-1000 mg/week total of injected anabolic steroids.

                    As with any anabolic steroid cycle, Dianabol should be followed with PCT (post-cycle therapy) employing Clomid, Nolvadex, or toremifene.</p>
