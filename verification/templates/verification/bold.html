              Boldenone undecylenate has a very low conversion to oestrogen and hence does not present excessive oestrogen side effects. Instead, boldenone undecylenate is converted by 5-alpha-reductase into dihydroboldenone and some of its androgenic effect mediated by dihydroboldenone.

              Boldenone undecylenate increases overall body metabolism rate and increases appetite.
              Its primary purpose is to increase red blood cell count whilst increasing lean body mass.
              Since Boldenone offers very few side effects it makes this anabolic/androgenic steroid (AAS) a good therapeutic choice for competitive athletes, bodybuilders and age-related non-genomic muscle degenerative diseases like sarcopenia.
              The undecylenate ester extends half-life of boldenone in circulation, which, depending on dose, is approximately 10 days.",

                <h2>HOW TO DILUTE/ CUT HIGH MG OILS</h2>
                <p>Some of our injectables are highly concentrated and will produce pain during injection and afterward (PIP) if injected directly.
                     To prevent this, you need to dilute (cut) these HIGH-MG injectables with a carrier oil/base.

                     Generally, anything above 250mg/ml should be diluted before injection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <h2>How to Dilute:</h2>
                <p>1.Determine which base you need:
                     Look at the ingredients list on the product page OR on the label.
                     Made with Grape seed oil (GSO)? Dilute with Sterile Oil.
                     Made with PEG/MEG/Glycol base? Dilute with PEG/MEG BASE.
                   2.Mix your product with the corresponding base in a syringe (or a new sterile vial).
                     Initially, mix with a 1:1 ratio, diluting more if needed.
                     Example: Mix 0.5ml of Gigatest 750 with 0.5ml grape seed oil in the same syringe.

                <h2>Dianabol Recommendations</h2>
                <p>The dosage range for Dianabol is typically 20-50 mg/day. Unlike most injectables, little further benefit occurs from going beyond this milligram amount. If wishing more effect, the answer is instead to add another anabolic steroid. My preference is for dosing to be 3-5 times per day, but some prefer to use it only once per day.

                    Typically, this usage is combined with about 500-1000 mg/week total of injected anabolic steroids.

                    As with any anabolic steroid cycle, Dianabol should be followed with PCT (post-cycle therapy) employing Clomid, Nolvadex, or toremifene.</p>
