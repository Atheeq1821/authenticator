               Primobolan Acetate is an ester derivative of Methenolone sold commonly under the brand names Primobolan (tablet form) or Primobolan Depot (injectable).
               When it interacts with the aromatase enzyme it does not form any estrogens. It is used by people who are very susceptible to estrogenic side effects, having lower estrogenic properties than nandrolone.
               Methenolone, in form of Enanthate and acetate, is available as an injection or as an oral formulation.
               The injection is regarded as having a higher bioavailability.
               It is an acetate ester which is quite short-acting.
               Because it by-passes hepatic breakdown on the first pass, it also has a higher survival rate.
               The tablets are in a short-lived acetate form. Methenolone is not 17-alpha-alkylated, but 1-methylated for oral bioavailability.
               This reduces the stress on the liver, but also the availability.",

                <h2>Stacking Dianabol with Injectable Steroids</h2>
                <p>The effect of most injectable anabolic steroids is greatly enhanced by the addition of Dianabol which helps build muscle fast. The improvement is greater than from simply increasing the amount of injectable by the same amount. A classic and dramatic example is trenbolone. Though the total amount of steroid used is the same in all three cases, 50 mg/day each of trenbolone acetate stacked with 50 mg/day Dianabol provides a far more effective steroid cycle than either 100 mg/day of trenbolone acetate alone or 100 mg/day Dbol alone. The side effect profile is superior as well. In other words, the compounds act synergistically:
                    the whole is greater than the parts. This is likely due to different mechanisms of action.</p>

                <h2>HOW TO DILUTE/ CUT HIGH MG OILS</h2>
                <p>Some of our injectables are highly concentrated and will produce pain during injection and afterward (PIP) if injected directly.
                     To prevent this, you need to dilute (cut) these HIGH-MG injectables with a carrier oil/base.

                    Generally, anything above 250mg/ml should be diluted before injection..</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <h2>How to Dilute:</h2>
                <p>1.Determine which base you need:
                    Look at the ingredients list on the product page OR on the label.
                    Made with Grape seed oil (GSO)? Dilute with Sterile Oil.
                    Made with PEG/MEG/Glycol base? Dilute with PEG/MEG BASE.
                  2.Mix your product with the corresponding base in a syringe (or a new sterile vial).
                    Initially, mix with a 1:1 ratio, diluting more if needed.
                    Example: Mix 0.5ml of Gigatest 750 with 0.5ml grape seed oil in the same syringe.
